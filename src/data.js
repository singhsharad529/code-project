If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the program writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of the hangman diagram as a tally mark. The game is over when the guessing player completes the word, or guesses the whole word correctly. The gaming code will mainly contain the class Hangman which will provide the list of good letters as well as the no. of chances given to a user. ',
